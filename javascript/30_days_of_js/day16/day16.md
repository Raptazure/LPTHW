## JSON

- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only.
- JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting. JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client.
- JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML.
- The difference between JSON and Object is the key of a JSON object should be with double quotes or it should be a string. In Object we usually use keys without double quotesJavaScript Object and JSON are very similar that we can change JSON to Object and Object to JSON.
