### JavaScript Coding Conventions

- Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming which are developed by an individual, a team or a company. We used the general JavaScript coding writing conventions and guides.
- Coding conventions helps:
  - to write clean code
  - to improve code readability
  - to improve code re-useability and maintainability
- Coding conventions includes:
  - Naming and declaration rules for variables
  - Naming and declaration rules for functions
  - Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments
  - Programming practices and principles
- Conventions use in 30DaysOfJavaScript:
  - We used camelCase for variables and functions.
  - All variable names start with a letter.
  - We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. Instead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
  - Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
  - Arrow function instead of function declaration
  - Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
  - No trailing comma in the last value of an object
  - We prefer this +=, -=, \*= /=, \*\*= instead of the longer version
  - When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming
