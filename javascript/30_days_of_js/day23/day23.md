## Event Listener

- Common HTML events: onclick, onchange, onmouseover, onmouseout, onkeydown, onkeyup, onload.
- We can add event listener method to any DOM object.
- We use addEventListener() method to listen different event types on HTML elements.
- The addEventListener() method takes two arguments, an event listener and a callback function.
- Lists of events:
  - click - when the element is clicked
  - dbclick - when the element is double clicked
  - mouseenter - when the mouse pointer enters to the element
  - mouseleave - when the mouse pointer leaves the element
  - mousemove - when the mouse pointer moves on the element
  - mouseover - when the mouse pointer moves on the element
  - mouseout - when the mouse pointer moves out from the element
  - input - when value is entered to input field
  - change - when value changes on input field
  - blur - when the element is not focused
  - keydown - when a key is down
  - keyup - when a key is up
  - keypress - when we press any key
  - onload - when the browser has finished loading a page

## Getting value from an input element

- We usually fill forms and forms accept data. Form fields are created using input HTML element.
